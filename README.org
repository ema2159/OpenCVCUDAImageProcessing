This project implements several image processing algorithms using OpenCV, and then accelerating the computations through parallel processing using either OpenMP or CUDA. In the Exercises 2 directory, further enhancements were applied to some of the algorithms by using CUDA's shared memory model

The algorithms implemented are the following:
- Hue shift transformation
- 2D kernel Gaussian filter
- Laplace filter
- Image arithmetic
- Image scaling
- Median filter
- Separable Gaussian filter
